# E-Commerce Recommendation Engine

This project implements a recommendation engine for e-commerce that suggests personalized product recommendations to users based on their shopping history and preferences.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- surprise
- sqlite3 (or any other database management system that you use)

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```python3
pip install pandas surprise sqlite3
```
OR
```python3
pip3 install pandas surprise sqlite3
```


## Usage
1. Load the shopping history and preferences data into a database.
2. Run the `recommendation_engine.py` file to train the recommendation engine and make recommendations for a given user.

## File Structure
- `recommendation_engine.py`: Main file containing the code for training the recommendation engine and making recommendations.

## Results
The recommendation engine uses a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model to make recommendations. The performance of the model can be evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics.
